Our work mainly implements on a RNN based NMT framework, and the released Transformer code only contains bi-directional decoding part. For using the bi-directional decoding, Users should train two NMT models, a forward one and a backward one.

Because I have graduated, I can't get the code now. But I am contacting my co-authers to push the RNN code.
